<H3>H19telnet</H3>

<P>H19telnet will connect to a listening socket and behave like
a Heath/Zenith H19 terminal.
It minimally must be supplied with a host name or IP address and a port number.
It has no scroll buffer and only keeps the last 24 lines of output.

<P>It does support simple copy/paste, with anything being pasted throttled by
a delay to avoid overrunning the host.

<H3>ASR33telnet</H3>

<P>ASR33telnet will connect to a listening socket and behave similarly
to an ASR-33 Teletype.
It minimally must be supplied with a host name or IP address and a port number.
It provides functionality similar to the paper tape reader and punch,
in addition to a text area that supports scrolling and an indefinite length.

<P>It supports simple copy/paste, with anything being pasted throttled by
a delay to avoid overrunning the host. The copy/paste hot keys are
Alt-C and Alt-V, since Ctrl is required by the software run on the MDS.
In addition, the Copy/Paste functions may be accessed from the "Print"
menu, and the mouse middle button will also Paste.

<P>See also the "Help" menu on the ASR33telnet.jar appliance.
