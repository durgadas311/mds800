<H2>Virtual MDS-800 Properties</H2>

Properties that begin with "mds800_" may be specified on the
commandline without the prefix.

<P>Note that the optional LST device LPT is always present
but is not assigned by default in the iobyte.
The default iobyte first digit may be set to "2" to assign LPT to LST
without making a manual assignment.

<P>A property (config) file may be specified on the commandline,
or a default is chosen from the CONFIG_MDS800 environment variable,
"mds800rc" in the current directory,
or ".mds800rc" in the user's home directory.

<H3>MDS-800 Properties</H3>

<DL>
<DT>mds800_log
<DD>Redirect simulation output to the specified file.
</DD>

<DT>mds800_mon
<DD>The specified image is used for the Monitor ROM.
May refer to the built image "intel_monitor.rom", or to any
(2K) file on the local computer.
<P>Note that the original (first revision) MDS-800 monitor board
used inverted address lines to drive the monitor ROM,
resulting in the physical ROM image being reversed.
This is the condition for the "intel_monitor.bin" file
posted on BitSavers. If a reversed image is to be used here,
the "rev" keyword should be appended after the file name (separated by a space).
</DD>

<DT>mds800_boot
<DD>The specified image is used for the Boot ROM.
May refer to the built image "1702_MDS.rom", or to any
(256B) file on the local computer.
</DD>

<DT>mds800_iobyte
<DD>The default iobyte in the Boot ROM may be overridden
using this property. The value must be a 4-digit base-4 (digits 0-3)
number that ends with "0". The digits represent fields in the iobyte,
with the first (most significant) digit being for LST, next for RDR,
and third for PUN. See the MDS-800 Operator's Manual for an explanation
of the iobyte. The default in the Boot ROM is "0000".
</DD>

<DT>mds800_ram
<DD>Specifies the amount of RAM installed, in K bytes.
Forced to a multiple of 4K. Default is 16K.
</DD>

<DT>mds800_fdc
<DD>"yes" specifies the existence of the Floppy Controller.
It causes a new rack to be added to the basic MDS chassis.
This version only supports single density and 2 drives.
</DD>

<DT>mds800_pt
<DD>"yes" specifies the existence of the High Speed Paper Tape
reader/punch.
It causes a new rack to be added to the basic MDS chassis.
The default iocyte PUN and RDR digits may be changed to "1" to use this device
without manual assignment.
</DD>

<DT>mds800_upp
<DD>"yes" specifies the existence of the Universal PROM Programmer.
It causes a new rack to be added to the basic MDS chassis.
</DD>

</DL>

<H3>CRT Device</H3>

<DL>
<DT>crt_att
<DD>Specifies how to connect to the CRT serial port.
Values are:
<DL>
<DT>TelnetSerial <I>host-or-ip</I> <I>port</I>
<DD>Telnet-like connection over TCP/IP sockets.
This works for the H19telnet.jar and ASR33telnet.jar appliances,
as well as telnet or other terminal programs that support telnet sockets.
</DD>
<DT>ASR33Serial <I>name</I>
<DD>Direct-connected ASR33 appliance.
This uses the same properties file as the MDS-800.
</DD>
<DT>H19Serial <I>name</I>
<DD>Direct-connected H19 appliance.
This uses the same properties file as the MDS-800.
</DD>
</DL>

</DD>
</DL>

<H3>TTY Device</H3>

<DL>
<DT>tty_att
<DD>Specifies how to connect to the TTY serial port.
Takes the same options as crt_att.

<P>In order to use the TTY paper tape reader (as implemented
in the ASR33 appliance), the "tty_rdr_adv_char" property
must be specified for both the ASR33 appliance and the High Speed
Paper Tape device, and both must use the same value.
Default is 0x0f (Ctrl-O).
</DD>
</DL>

<H3>Floppy Disk Controller</H3>

<DL>

<DT>fdc_disk<I>unit</I>
<DD>Where <I>unit</I> is "1" or "2".
Specifies the initial floppy image file to be inserted in the drive.
Note that by default this image is R/O. To make it R/W, append a "rw" keyword
after the file name.
</DD>

<DT>fdc_intr
<DD>Not Used. Specifies the interrupt level to use for the controller.
FDC interrupts are not supported.
</DD>

</DL>

<H3>High Speed Paper Tape</H3>

<DL>

<DT>ptp_att
<DD>Specifies the initial file (paper tape image) to be attached to the punch
for output. Paper tape images are plain text files, although binary files
may result if binary data is punched.</DD>

<DT>ptr_att
<DD>Specifies the initial file (paper tape image) to be attached to the reader
for input. Paper tape images are plain text files, although binary files
may be used if the reading software expects that.</DD>

<DT>tty_rdr_adv_char<BR>
mds800_rdr_adv_char
<DD>Specifies the control character to use to cause the TTY
device to read a single character from its papert tape reader.
Note, this does not affect the high spead reader, but the hardware for
triggering the TTY reader is bound to the high spead paper tape.
Default is 0x0f (Ctrl-O).
</DD>

<DT>ptp_rdr_view
<DD>Specifies the number of characters before and after the current
to show in the tape positioner. Default is 8. Must be between 1 and 30.
