<H3>Running The Simulation</H3>

<P>The general command syntax is:

<P><KBD>java -jar VirtualMDS800.jar [<I>cfg</I>] [<I>prop</I>=<I>value</I>...]</KBD>

<DL>
<DT><I>cfg</I>
<DD>is the name of a file containing configuration properties.</DD>

<DT><I>prop</I>=<I>value</I>
<DD>are property assignments that override any
given in <I>cfg</I>. <I>prop</I> will be prefixed by <B>mds800_</B>
unless it begins with a period. Remember to enclose <I>value</I> in quotes if
required by your shell.</DD>
</DL>

<H3>Operating The MDS-800</H3>

<P>Operating the MDS-800 simulation is very similar to using the real
hardware. Most procedures are covered by the
<A HREF="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/intel/MDS800/98-129A_MDS800_Operator_Manual_1975.pdf">
MDS-800 Operator's Manual</A> available on BitSavers.

<P>The general producedure to run the monitor is:
<OL>
<LI>Start the simulation
<LI>Start appliances for the CRT (and optionally TTY) ports
<LI>Set the power switch to ON
<LI>Set the BOOT switch on
<LI>Press the RESET switch
<LI>Hit the SPACE key on the CRT appliance (or TTY, if that
is to be the console)
<LI>Look for the monitor signon message (booting from disk does not print anything)
<LI>Set the BOOT switch to OFF
<LI>The console should show signon messages and command prompts, and be ready
for input
</OL>

<P>The general procedure for booting an OS from flopy diskette is:
<OL>
<LI>Start the simulation (with FDC device and sufficient memory installed)
<LI>Start appliances for the CRT (and optionally TTY) ports
<LI>Set the power switch to ON
<LI>Insert the desired boot disk in the first drive
<LI>Set the BOOT switch on
<LI>Press the RESET switch
<LI>Hit the SPACE key on the CRT appliance (or TTY, if that
is to be the console)
<LI>Look for disk drive activity to subside
<LI>Set the BOOT switch to OFF
<LI>The console should show signon messages and command prompts, and be ready
for input
</OL>

<H4>Menus</H4>

<DL>
<DT>System
<DD><DL>
	<DT>Reset
	<DD>Same as the RESET button on the front panel</DD>
	<DT>Quit
	<DD>End the simulation</DD>
</DL></DD>
<DT>Debug
<DD>Lots of options for debugging what is going in the machine.
Note the "Dump to Log" item, which changes where the subsequent
debug dumps are displayed. By default, they display in a pop-up window (GUI).
Setting to "Log" causes them to be printed to the simulation log, which may be set to a
file using properties but defaults to the terminal window.
</DD>
<DT>I/O
<DD>Lists peripherals that might be hidden at any given time.
These include direct-attached CRT and TTY devices (if configured)
as well as the always-present LPT.
Selecting the specific peripheral will make the window visible and raised.
</DD>
<DT>Disks
<DD>(net yet implemented) Same as clicking on a disk drive.
</DD>
</DL>

<H3>Floppy Disk Controller</H3>

<P>The floppy disk controller allows selecting a file to use for
the diskette image for each drive.
Click on the drive to change the image file.
Hovering over the drive shows the image currently inserted.
Note that "DRIVE 0", the first drive, is on the right side.

<P>Images must be for 8" single-density, single-sided, media.
If the diskette image is to be used for CP/M, then "cpmtools" may
be used to alter the contents. Typically, start with a copy of the
"blank.logdisk" image and add files.

<P>The initial image in a drive may be set using properties.

<H3>High Speed Paper Tape</H3>

<P>The high speed paper tape device allows selecting a file to use for
punch output or reader input by clicking on the PUNCH or READER component.
Hovering over the component shows the image currently inserted.

<P>The initial image in the PUNCH or READER may be set using properties.

<P>The tape in the reader may be positioned by right-clicking on the READER component.
The reader is disabled during positioning.
The keys UP, DOWN, PAGE_UP, and PAGE_DOWN, along with the
mouse wheel, will reposition the tape.
HOME jumps to the beginning, and END jumps to the end.
Press ENTER or Close the window to set the new position and release the reader.

<H3>Universal PROM Programmer</H3>

<P>The universal PROM programmer allows selecting a file to use for
PROM input or output by clicking on the socket where the PROM is to be
inserted. Limitations exist based on the configuration of the specific socket,
which is done using properties.
Hovering over the socket shows the image currently inserted.
