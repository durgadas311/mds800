<H2>ADM3A Terminal Properties</H2>

<P>Properties with the "adm3a_" prefix may be specified on the
commandline by removing the prefix.
Quotes around values may be required, depending on your shell.

<P>The terminal will search for a file containing properties
in the following order:

<OL>
<LI>The first existing file on the commandline
<LI>Using the environment variable ADM3A_CONFIG
<LI>Looking for "adm3arc" in the current directory
<LI>Looking for ".adm3arc" in the user's home directory
</OL>

<DL>
<DT>adm3a_ansbak
<DD>Specifies a string to use for the Answer-back drum.
Typically, this drum generated NUL characters, and that is the default.
A maximum of 20 characters is used, with the remaining positions
on the drum being left as NUL characters.
This string may include the standard "escapes" for special characters,
such as "\r" for CR and "\n" for LF.
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_delay
<DD>The delay inserted after each character is pasted or otherwise
automatically sent to the host, in milliseconds. Default is 100.
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_font
<DD>Specifies the font to use for the display. Generally, only
the built-in font "fonts/ADM3A.ttf" will work properly,
as the character codes need to match what is used internally
to select the control character glyphs and reverse-video glyphs.
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_font_size
<DD>Specifies the font size to use for the display.
The optimal vallue for the built-in font is "18", the
default.
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_font_color
<DD>Specifies the font color to use for the display.
The value is specified in RGB hexadecimal, for example
green would be "00ff00".
The default is green.

<DT>adm3a_beep
<DD>Specifies the audio clip file to use for the terminal beep.
Default is the built-in "adm3a_beep.wav".
There also exists a built-in "h19beep.wav".
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_beep_volume
<DD>Specifies the audio volume to use for the terminal beep,
in percent. Default is "50".
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_loopback
<DD>This is a special mode that sends all keys pressed back to
the terminal, bypassing any connected computer.
It cannot be turned off without restarting the terminal
(without the property being set).
It is generally only useful for test purposes.
No value is require, however when specifying on the
commandline it must include the "=".
</DD>

</DL>

<H3>ADM3A Telnet Properties</H3>

<DL>
<DT>adm3a_host
<DD>The hostname or IP address to connect to.
This is the same as the first non-property, non-config-file, argument
on the command line.
</DD>

<DT>adm3a_port
<DD>The port number to connect to.
This is the same as the second non-property, non-config-file, argument
on the command line.
</DD>

</DL>
