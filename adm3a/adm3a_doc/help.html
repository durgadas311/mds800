<H3>Running</H3>

<P>The general command syntax for the telnet version is:
<P><KBD>java -jar ADM3Atelnet.jar [<I>cfg</I>] [<I>prop</I>=<I>value</I>...] [<I>host</I> <I>port</I>]</KBD>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<P>Text on the screen may be selected using the left mouse button
and dragging the usual way. Text remains selected until it scrolls off
the screen or another mouse button click.

<P>The menu item Screen->Copy, or key Alt-C, copies the current
selection to the clipboard. This is generally done automatically
when the mouse button is released, but may be used to re-copy the
current selection if the clipboard contents gets replaced
by use outside of the terminal.

<P>The menu item Screen->Paste, or key Alt-V, copies the current
contents of the clipboard to the terminal output (sends to the
computer). The text is sent at the rate specified by the
adm3a_delay property.

<P>The menu item Screen->Copy_All, or key Alt-A, copies the
antire current screen text to the clipboard.

<H4>Telnet version</H4>

<P>The menu item Screen->Reconnect will attempt to
reconnect to the computer using the same host and port
previously specified, provided the current connection was lost.

<P>The menu item Screen->Hangup will disconnect
the terminal from the computer (release the telnet connection).

<P>The menu item Screen->New_Connection will
prompt for a new host and port and attempt to connect.
This is done after doing a hangup of any currrent connection.

<H3>Keyboard</H3>

<P>F12 functions as the HERE IS key. The answer-back
drum defaults to NUL characters, but may be set to
a string using the "ansbak" property (20 characters maximum).
The data is sent using the same delay as for paste operations.

<P>F1 will cancel any current paste or HERE IS transission
being done. This is especially useful is an excessively
large amount of text is accidentally pasted.

<P>The Enter key produces CR, use Ctrl-J or Ctrl-Enter for LF.

<P>Delete or Shift-Backspace sends the RUB code (DEL/Rubout) (0x7f)

<P>The cursor keys send the equivalent cursor movement codes.

<P>The Home key sends the HOME cursor code.
