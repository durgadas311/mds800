<H2>ASR33 Teletype Help</H2>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<P>The menu item PTape->Punch selects a file to use for the paper tape punch.
Any previous content is lost. Editing (backspacing) is not supported.

<P>The menu item PTape->Reader selects a file to use for the paper tape reader.
In order to re-wind a file, re-select it from this menu.
Positioning to a specific location is not supported.

<P>LOCAL checkbox selects between LOCAL (checked) or LINE (unchecked)
mode of operation. In LOCAL mode all characters from the remote
are dropped and keys pressed are not sent to the remote but
rather printed locally.

<P>If a file has been mounted on the Punch device, the PUNCH
checkbox indicates whether the punch is on - in which case
anything printed will also be punched.

<P>If a file has been mounted on the Reader device,
the READER checkbox indicates whether the reader is
enabled (ready) - in which case it is turned on and off by
X-ON and X-OFF characters or does a single-character
read if a command is received.

<P>This implementation recognizes the SI character (Ctrl-O, 0x0F)
to trigger a single character read from tape.
That character may be changed with the "rdr_adv_char" property.

<P>If the Reader is in the ready state, the "start"
button may be used to start reading tape and sending to the remote.
Whenever the reader is active, the "start" button will be
illuminated.

<H3>Keyboard</H3>

<P>F12 functions as the HERE IS key. The answer-back
drum defaults to NUL characters, but may be set to
a string using the "ansbak" property (20 characters maximum).

<P>Enter produces CR, use Ctrl-J for LF.

<P>All characters in the upper ASCII-7 bank except DEL (0x7f)
are folded into the upper-case bank.

<P>Delete produces the RUB OUT character 0xff.

<P>The menu item Print->Copy (also Alt-C)
will copy any selected text (the usual mouse click-drag) to the clipboard.

<P>The menu item Print->Paste (also Alt-V or middle mouse button)
will paste text from the clipboard as keyboard input.

<H3>Misc</H3>

<P>Characters transmitted for the Reader or HERE IS function,
or pasted into the window,
are delayed according to the "delay" property, the number
of milliseconds to delay after each character.
Default is 100 milliseconds.

<P>Pasted text being transmitted may be cancelled by pressing the F1 key.

<P>If the connection to the remote is lost or not present to begin with,
the menu item Print->Reconnect may be used to attempt to re-connect to the remote.
The host and port may not be changed.

<P>Currently, the printer window does not properly handle CR.
A CR-LF pair will be fine, but attempts to use CR alone will not have
good results. The CR character essentially does nothing, so characters
following the CR do not overwrite at the beginning of the line but rather
continue on at the end of the line.
