<P><A HREF="properties.html">Properties</A>

<H3>Running</H3>

<P>The general command syntax is:
<P><KBD>java -jar ASR33telnet.jar [<I>cfg</I>] [<I>prop</I>=<I>value</I>...] [<I>host</I> <I>port</I>]</KBD>

<H3>Controls</H3>

<P>The menu item PTape->Punch selects a file to use for the paper tape punch.
Any previous content is lost.
Clicking "Cancel" leaves no file selected (punch not operational).
Editing (backspacing) is not supported.

<P>The menu item PTape->Reader selects a file to use for the paper tape reader.
In order to re-wind a file, re-select it from this menu.
Clicking "Cancel" leaves no file selected (reader not operational).

<P>LOCAL checkbox selects between LOCAL (checked) or LINE (unchecked)
mode of operation. In LOCAL mode all characters from the remote
are dropped and keys pressed are not sent to the remote but
rather printed locally.

<P>If a file has been mounted on the Punch device, the PUNCH
checkbox indicates whether the punch is on - in which case
anything printed will also be punched.

<P>If a file has been mounted on the Reader device,
the READER checkbox indicates whether the reader is
enabled (ready) - in which case it is turned on and off by
X-ON and X-OFF characters or does a single-character
read if a command is received.

<P>This implementation recognizes the SI character (Ctrl-O, 0x0F)
to trigger a single character read from tape.
That character may be changed with the "rdr_adv_char" property.

<P>If the Reader is in the ready state, the "start"
button may be used to start reading tape and sending to the remote.
Whenever the reader is active, the "start" button will be
illuminated.

<P>The menu item PTape->Rdr_Position will pop-up with window
allowing positioning of the paper tape in the reader.
The reader is disabled during this operation.
The keys UP, DOWN, PAGE_UP, and PAGE_DOWN, along with the
mouse wheel, will reposition the tape.
HOME jumps to the beginning, and END jumps to the end.
Press ENTER or Close the window to set the new position and release the reader.

<H3>Keyboard</H3>

<P>F12 functions as the HERE IS key. The answer-back
drum defaults to NUL characters, but may be set to
a string using the "ansbak" property (20 characters maximum).

<P>The Enter key produces CR, use Ctrl-J for LF.

<P>All characters in the last ASCII-7 bank (lower case letters, etc) except DEL (0x7f)
are folded into the upper-case bank.

<P>The Delete key produces the RUBOUT character 0x7f.

<P>The menu item Print->Copy (also Alt-C)
will copy any selected text (the usual mouse click-drag) to the clipboard.

<P>The menu item Print->Paste (also Alt-V or middle mouse button)
will paste text from the clipboard as keyboard input.

<H3>Misc</H3>

<P>Two modes are possible for the telnet version, "server" or client.

<P>Characters transmitted for the Reader or HERE IS function,
or pasted into the window,
are delayed according to the "delay" property, the number
of milliseconds to delay after each character.
Default is 100 milliseconds.

<P>Pasted text being transmitted may be cancelled by pressing the F1 key.

<P>Currently, the printer window does not properly handle CR.
A CR-LF pair will be fine, but attempts to use CR alone will not have
good results. The CR character essentially does nothing, so characters
following the CR do not overwrite at the beginning of the line but rather
continue on at the end of the line.

<H3>Telnet version</H3>

<P>(client) If the connection to the remote is lost or not present to begin with,
the menu item Print->Reconnect may be used to attempt to re-connect to the remote
using the same host and port.

<P>(client) A new, different, connection may be specified using the
Print->New_Connection menu item.

<P>The current connection may be dropped using the Print->Hangup menu item.
