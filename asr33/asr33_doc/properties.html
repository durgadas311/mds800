<H2>ASR33 Teletype Properties</H2>

<P>Properties with the "asr33_" prefix may be specified on the
commandline by removing the prefix.
Quotes around values may be required, depending on your shell.

<P>The terminal will search for properties
in the following order:

<OL>
<LI><I>prop</I>=<I>value</I> arguments on the commandline
<LI>The first existing file on the commandline
<LI>Using the environment variable ASR33_CONFIG
<LI>Looking for "asr33rc" in the current directory
<LI>Looking for ".asr33rc" in the user's home directory
</OL>

<P>Only one proerties file will be used - they are not combined.

<DL>
<DT>asr33_ansbak
<DD>Specifies a string to use for the Answer-back drum.
Typically, this drum generated NUL characters, and that is the default.
A maximum of 20 characters is used, with the remaining positions
on the drum being left as NUL characters.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_delay
<DD>The delay inserted after each character is pasted or otherwise
automatically sent to the host, in milliseconds. Default is 100.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_rdr_adv_char<BR>
tty_rdr_adv_char
<DD>The control character to use for performing a single-character
read operation ("advance") on the paper tape reader.
This emulates the Teletype feature of a solenoid on the reader
that is activated by a handshake signal on the host interface.
This needs to match whatever is used on the host (e.g. MDS-800)
to trigger the reader advance. Default is 0x0f (Ctrl-O).
</DD>

<DT>asr33_rdr_view
<DD>The number of characters before and after the current in
the reader tape positioning view. Default is 8.
Must be between 1 and 30.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_bell
<DD>The audio file to use for the bell sound.
This file is buffered in memory, so needs to be small.
Default is "bell.wav".
</DD>

<DT>asr33_bell_volume
<DD>Specifies the audio volume to use for the bell,
in percent. Default is "50".
</DD>

<DT>asr33_lines
<DD>Specifies the number of lines to view in the text window.
Minimum is 10. Default is 24. Scrolling still allows viewing the entire
printed text, this property only affects the view size.
Beware of impractical numbers for your screen size.
</DD>
</DL>

<H3>ASR33 Legacy Option Properties</H3>

<P>The following properties accept the values (case-insensitive)

<DD>Enables the Print/Nonprint option, which adds a button
to control whether or not received characters are printed
(they are always punched if the punch is on).
Default is off.
</DD>

<DD>Enables generation of parity in the 8th bit of keyboard codes.
