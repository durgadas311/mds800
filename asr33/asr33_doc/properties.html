<H2>ASR33 Teletype Properties</H2>

<P>Properties with the "asr33_" prefix may be specified on the
commandline by removing the prefix.
Quotes around values may be required, depending on your shell.

<DL>
<DT>asr33_ansbak
<DD>Specifies a string to use for the Answer-back drum.
Typically, this drum generated NUL characters, and that is the default.
A maximum of 20 characters is used, with the remaining positions
on the drum being left as NUL characters.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_delay
<DD>The delay inserted after each character is pasted or otherwise
automatically sent to the host, in milliseconds. Default is 100.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_rdr_adv_char<BR>
tty_rdr_adv_char
<DD>The control character to use for performing a single-character
read operation ("advance") on the paper tape reader.
This emulates the Teletype feature of a solenoid on the reader
that is activated by a handshake signal on the host interface.
This needs to match whatever is used on the host (e.g. MDS-800)
to trigger the reader advance. Default is 0x0f (Ctrl-O).
</DD>

<DT>asr33_rdr_view
<DD>The number of characters before and after the current in
the reader tape positioning view. Default is 8.
Must be between 1 and 30.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_bell
<DD>The audio file to use for the bell sound.
Default is "ding.wav".
</DD>

<DT>asr33_bell_volume
<DD>Specifies the audio volume to use for the bell,
in percent. Default is "50".
</DD>
</DL>

<H3>ASR33 Telnet Properties</H3>

<DL>
<DT>asr33_host
<DD>The hostname or IP address to connect to.
This is the same as the first non-property, non-config-file, argument
on the command line.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_port
<DD>The port number to connect to.
This is the same as the second non-property, non-config-file, argument
on the command line.
</DD>

<DT>asr33_server
<DD>Sets server mode, where the ASR33 listens on the specified host and port,
simulating a standalone case where the ASR33 waits for connections from remote ASR33s.
Value is ignored, but must be present ("=" at least) when given on the commandline.
</DD>
</DL>
